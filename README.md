cmake
dlib
opencv
face_recognition
cvzone
numpy
pickle
firebase
```

### Steps involved so far :

* Importing the required libraries.
* Setting up the webcam and importing the required graphics.
* Creating the encoding generator.
* Implementing face recognition algorithms to show whether faces are correctly detected and matched or not.
* Setting up the database, here Firebase.
* Adding data to the database.
